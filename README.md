# Roguelike UI

The Rogue-like theme for Atom.

FEATURES
- @, hero of legend as your fearless cursor.
- UI is smart enough to know you didn't mean to use it with a light syntax theme so it automatically inverts the editor in those rare cases.
- Doesn't over encumber you like [those other themes](https://atom.io/themes/notebook-ui).
