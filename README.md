# Roguelike UI

The Rogue-like theme for Atom. Based on the original [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)) release for IBM PC, though with some elements from later roguelikes like @ rather than the smiley face of the original.

## Features
- @, hero of legend as your fearless cursor.
- UI is smart enough to know you didn't mean to use it with a light syntax theme so it automatically inverts the editor in those rare cases.
- Doesn't over encumber you like [those other themes](https://atom.io/themes/notebook-ui).

## Credits
- @Atom One Dark UI team - core UI.
- @Ugotsta - implemented @ as cursor.
- @Michael Toy, @Glenn Wichman and other @contributors - [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game).
